# CalorieManagement
Front-end web application using React for managing daily calorie intake

 Implemented state management with useState for dynamic user interactions and seamless navigation between components. Utilized the Fetch API to handle network requests, employing Request and Response objects to interact with RESTful Web Services, and ensuring proper handling of CORS and HTTP Origin header semantics. Leveraged IndexedDB for client-side data storage, implementing an asynchronous library (idb.js) to handle CRUD operations with Promises.
